# Project 6: Brevet time calculator service

Simple listing service from project 5 stored in MongoDB database.

## What is in this repository

You have a minimal implementation of Docker compose in DockerRestAPI folder,
using which you can create REST API-based services (as demonstrated in 
class). Refer to the lecture slide "05a-Mongo-Docker-Compose.pdf" (dated 
02/15/2018) for information about how to use Docker compose. 

## Recap 

You will reuse *your* code from project
5 (https://github.com/UOCIS322/proj5-mongo). Recall: you created the 
following functionalities. 1) Two buttons ("Submit") and ("Display") in
the page where you have controle times. 2) On clicking the Submit 
button, the control times were be entered into the database. 3) On 
clicking the Display button, the entries from the database were be 
displayed in a new page. You also handled error cases appropriately. 

## Functionality you will add

This project has three parts: 

* You will design RESTful service to expose what is stored in MongoDB.
Specifically, you'll use the boilerplate given in DockerRestAPI folder, and
create the following:

   "http://<host:port>/listAll" should return all open and close times in the database
   
   "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly" should return open times only
   
   "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly" should return close times only

* You will also design two different representations: one in csv and one 
 in json. For the above, JSON should be your default representation. 

   "http://<host:port>/listAll/csv" should return all open and close times in CSV format
   
   "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/csv" should return open times only in CSV format
   
   "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly/csv" should return close times only in CSV format

   "http://<host:port>/listAll/json" should return all open and close times in JSON format
   
   "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/json" should return open times only in JSON format
   
   "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly/json" should return close times only in JSON format

* You will also add a query parameter to get top "k" open and close
times. For examples, see below.

   "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/csv?top=3" should return top 3 open times only (in ascending order) in CSV format 
   
   "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/json?top=5" should return top 5 open times only (in ascending order) in JSON format

* You'll also design consumer programs (e.g., in jQuery) to use the service
  that you expose. "website" inside DockerRestAPI is an example of that. It is
  uses PHP. You're welcome to use either PHP or jQuery to consume your
  services. NOTE: your consumer program should be in a different container like
  example in DockerRestAPI.

## Tasks

You'll turn in your credentials.ini using which we will get the following:

* The working application with three parts.

* Dockerfile

* docker-compose.yml
